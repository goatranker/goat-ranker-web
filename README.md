This is my Final Project from General Assembly. A Full stack application goatranker.com for web. This app has full integration with Spotify allowing users to listen to music as well as vote for who they think is the greatest of all time in different genre categories. 

To listen to music search any artist just like you would on spotify and click on any song. In the drawer there is a music player that works on desktop and mobile. Music does not auto play.
